# MinHash Signature

MinHash is a technique for quickly estimating how similar two sets are. The original applications for MinHash involved clustering and eliminating near-duplicates among web documents, represented as sets of the words occurring in those documents. Similar techniques have also been used for clustering and near-duplicate elimination for other types of data, such as images: in the case of image data, an image can be represented as a set of smaller subimages cropped from it, or as sets of more complex image feature descriptions

Compute the minhash signature for each column if we use the following three hash functions: h1(x) = 2x + 1 mod 6; h2(x) = 3x + 2 mod 6; h3(x) = 5x + 2 mod 6.
